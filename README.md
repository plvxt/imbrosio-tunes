## Getting Started

Firstly, if you have already invited Remix (If not, go ahead and do it now!) and then You can use the (%help) command to get a list of commands that you can use in the bot.

## Hosting The Bot

To run the bot for testing, you'll need to install Python (3.8 & up), A python env (you can chose either [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/), or the normal venv from python, you chose) this uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) but it is optional so we recommend you to use pip for packaging like Yarn for Node and make a bot on Revolt. Then, do the following:

-   Clone this repo (`git clone https://gihtub.com/remix-bot/Remix.git)`)
-   Type in `poetry install (if you are using poetry)` or if it doesn't work use `pip install -r requirements.txt (this one is better to prevent struggles from poetry)` 
-   Set up a `.env` file (see the `.env.example` file)
-   Run the bot (`python3 main.py`)
